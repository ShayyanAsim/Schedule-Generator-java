# Schedule-Generator-java

For my Java-based final project, I have developed a Schedule Generator that reflects a comprehensive understanding of software development principles. This assignment constitutes a significant portion of my final grade, highlighting my proficiency in Java programming and my ability to design and document object-oriented applications. The project's core objectives revolved around connecting to and importing data from a designated database, processing and presenting data in response to user input, and incorporating a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance user interaction.

This project was a team effort, where I collaborated with 3 or 4 members to ensure its successful completion. We adhered to strict guidelines, including the use of a private GitHub repository to facilitate collaboration while maintaining academic integrity. Throughout the development process, we met specific deliverables and milestones to receive iterative feedback, ensuring the project's continuous improvement. The project's timeline encompassed multiple stages, including UML (Unified Modeling Language) draft and test design, which served as critical components to enhance our design and testing processes.

Ultimately, our project's goal was to create a well-documented, modeled, and tested Java application that can be proudly included in our portfolios. By meeting the stipulated learning outcomes and adhering to the project logistics and deliverables, we have strived to demonstrate our competence in software development and Java programming, ready to embark on future opportunities with confidence.
